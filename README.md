Listen, This was my first mod I made for SPT essentially. I highly recommend Tyfon Weapon Customizer as well since some of the attachments
need some fiddling to be good in game. That means this mod is a lil scuffed but I have not run into any incompatibilities so far on 4.0.x.
including when running EpicsAIO or Ecos Attachment Emporium. If you are worried if this breaks balance or something, Idk what to tell you other than im straight groggin it. If you want to be able to customize most of the guns in the game a bit better at the cost of some "groggy"ness this mod is for you. Chances are I will forget to update it, this is my contribution to the community.

The Reason I recommend Tyfons Weapon Customizer is because some attachments (like the MDR handguards on other guns) are completely
out of alignment and need to be worked into place with the Weapon Customizer to look good but technically having an attachment
floating off your gun does not stop it from shooting in SPT. Also, if it moves (bipod, mag, pump) chances are moving it yourself will
mean it doesn't move in game (extending bipod, changing mag, hand pump on pump shotties- that is a Weapon Customizer thing that I think
is tied to BSG code so no ones fault, just reality.)

Any problems? Chances are I have no clue how to fix it but I have not had any issues myself. Don't like it and wanna un-install? Go in game, remove all customizations/presets you made and then uninstall the mods from the mods folder. I have done this a few times and it seems to uninstall just fine too. 

Do not install the VirusTotal notes into your spt directory, thats just for your peace of mind if you wanna check.

GL have fun! - DaGrog
