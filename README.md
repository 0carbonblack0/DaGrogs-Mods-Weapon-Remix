Listen, This was my first mod I made for SPT essentially. I highly recommend Tyfon Weapon Customizer as well since some of the attachments
need some fiddling to be good in game. That means this mod is a lil scuffed but I have not run into any incompatibilities so far on 4.0.x.
If you are worried if this breaks balance or something, Idk what to tell you. If you want to be able to customize most of the guns in the game
a bit better this mod is for you. Chances are I will forget to update it, this is my contribution to the community. Any problems? I have no clue how
to fix it but I have not had any issues myself. GL have fun!
